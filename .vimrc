" Important_keyboard_changes: -> orderer by importance
"   I changed many things, those are just the important ones, which you should
"   really know. In my opinion it is important, that the more used commands
"   have easier shortcuts. Therefore I switched some commands, like the marks.
"     > mapped jj to <ESC> in normal mode [I really like fast escapes]
"     > changed ; and , [more comfortable]
"     > changed m and ' [to use marks it should be fast available, m is faster]
"     > changed q and @ [again: faster]
"     > control+w saves
"     > changed # and *, because that's more typical for a german keyboard layout
"     > ä is able to input one character in normal mode and stay there
"     > mapleader: ö
"
" Important_addons:
"   - folding with h possible, if you're at the first line.
"   - tabbing is very powerfull, with snippets and autocompletion
