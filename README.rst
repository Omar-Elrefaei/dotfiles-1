Dotfiles
========

.. warning:: My dotfiles also contain my git config, which means that you would
   commit using my mail address. So fork this first.


My dotfiles:

- VIM config: ``.vimrc``, ``.vim``
- bash config: ``.bashrc.local``
- git config: ``.gitconfig``
- readline config: ``.inputrc``
- W3M config: ``.w3m``


Installation
------------

You can install these files by using:

    ./install.sh

If you also want to install the dependencies (only ubuntu/debian until now):

    install_dependencies.sh
